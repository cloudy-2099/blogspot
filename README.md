# Social Profile Website (Laravel + Livewire)

This project is a social profile web application built with **Laravel** and **Livewire**.  
It provides a simple but powerful interactive UI with real-time components, without needing full page reloads.

### Features
- **User Profile Page**  
  Each user has a profile page with multiple tabs:
  - **Posts**: Display the user's published posts.
  - **Comments**: Show comments received from other users with pagination.
  - **Likes**: List of posts the user liked.
  - **Followers**: Users who follow this profile.

- **Follow/Unfollow System**  
  Authenticated users can follow or unfollow other users.

- **Livewire Components**  
  All tabs (posts, comments, likes, followers) are powered by Livewire components, making data loading and pagination seamless.

- **Smart Pagination UI**  
  Pagination remains in place (sticky position) even if the page has fewer items than the limit, ensuring consistent UX.

### Tech Stack
